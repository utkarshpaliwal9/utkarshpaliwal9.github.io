                        I'm a backend engineer who measures success by what <em>doesn't</em> happen—no 3 AM pages, no data inconsistencies, no unexplained failures. My job is to build systems that operators can trust and forget about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of my work lives in the unglamorous middle: data extraction pipelines that handle edge cases gracefully, cloud infrastructure that scales without intervention, and monitoring that surfaces real problems instead of noise. I've learned that the best systems aren't the cleverest ones—they're the ones that fail predictably and recover automatically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think in trade-offs. Every technical decision has costs, and I've developed strong opinions about when to optimize for simplicity versus flexibility, when to build versus buy, and when "good enough" is actually the right answer. I prefer owning problems end-to-end rather than passing tickets between teams.

                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>
                        The existing data extraction system was a collection of scheduled scripts that pulled from 15+ external sources. It failed silently, had no retry logic, and required manual intervention 2-3 times per week. When it broke, nobody knew until downstream reports showed stale data—sometimes days later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The business impact was real: compliance reports were delayed, customer data was inconsistent, and the team was spending 20% of their time firefighting instead of building.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-section">
                    <h4>Constraints</h4>
                    <ul class="case-list">
                        <li>Zero downtime during migration—existing pipelines couldn't stop</li>
                        <li>External APIs had rate limits, inconsistent schemas, and no change notifications</li>
                        <li>Data had to be consistent across sources (eventual consistency acceptable, but bounded)</li>
                        <li>Team bandwidth was limited—solution had to be operationally simple</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="case-section">
                    <h4>My Approach</h4>
                    <p>
                        I started by instrumenting the existing system to understand actual failure patterns—not assumed ones. This revealed that 80% of failures came from three sources with specific, fixable issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rather than a big-bang rewrite, I designed a parallel pipeline architecture using AWS Step Functions. Each extraction became an independent state machine with built-in retries, exponential backoff, and dead-letter queues for manual inspection. I introduced checkpointing so failed runs could resume rather than restart.
                    </p>

                        Our CloudWatch alarms were generating 50+ alerts daily, most of which were transient or duplicates. I built an alert aggregation layer that correlated related alerts, suppressed known-transient issues, and added context from recent deployments.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-impact">
                        <strong>Result:</strong> Reduced actionable alerts by 70% while catching the same number of real incidents. On-call burden dropped significantly.

                        Designed a distributed rate limiting system for our public API that handled burst traffic gracefully. Used token bucket algorithm with Redis, but the interesting part was the backpressure mechanism—instead of hard rejecting requests, we implemented queue-based smoothing for premium clients.
